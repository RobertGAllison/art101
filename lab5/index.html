			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner and entering the world of javascript.<br>
					Learning about declaring variables and different data types they can hold.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I guess the only issues we had as a group was organizing our code. <br>
					Perhaps it might be a better idea to start these html, css and js files from scratch rather than using the template ones.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a rather chill assignment and while we had to resort to text chatting as partners throughout it<br>
					 due to some unforseen circumstances (roommates watching borat), it went well and our communication was constant.</p>
