					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to do some proper pseudocoding and understand why it's a helpful technique.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We weren't sure if we were doing the pseudocoding correctly as we are not Javacript saavy <br>
					and aren't entirely sure how to break down some of the tasks in a way that would easily translate to coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, the assignment went very well and we both worked through our confusion and lack of confidence in our work here.</p>
			</div>
