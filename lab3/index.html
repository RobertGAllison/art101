			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>We had to create and connect the many different parts of our repository using the instruction on file structure within this lab.<br>
					 We had to do this only using the limited HTML and CSS we know at this point, leading to more exploration and experimentation during the assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems that arose for me were getting Github to actually update my page in a timely manner.<br>
					It loves to take way too long for simple updates.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I've been sick this past few week so I got to this assignment very late and didn't have the time to nab a partner for it.<br>
					Despite this setback, I was glad to finally feel well enough to get to this assignment because it answered many questions I had about links in HTML.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
