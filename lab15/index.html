        <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this lab was learning what API's are, what a library is (in relation to API's), and how to use them within your code.</p>

    <div id="problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I don't even know what an API really is still, kind of a general term it seems.<br>
            It's almost like it's just a term for the front facing end of these libraries that let you access the information within for your own coding purposes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Not sure if I did it right but I got the informatiion from the API to list itself?</p>
